## Quick start

Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

```css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://byoti-css.netlify.app/components/byoti-v1.css">

```

## Documentation

The documentation lives at [byoti-css.netflify.app/docs](https://byoti-css.netlify.app/). You'll be able to find detailed documentation on usage and the list of all components. 

## Credits

This project wouldn't have come out this way without been inspired by [Spectre.css](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).
